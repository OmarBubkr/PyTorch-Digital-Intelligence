# Construction of Digital Reasoning Models with PyTorch
# Definition of Digital Intelligence(DI):
# Feild of study that developes digital brains simulating the biological brain, 
# based on The Process of Layered Processing and Probabilistic Modeling
#\n
# The Process of Layered Processing: Simulating the cordical processes 
# Probabilistic Modeling: Simulating the Prefrontal Cortex's logical reasoning and rational decison making 
# Prefrontal Cortex: Decision Center
