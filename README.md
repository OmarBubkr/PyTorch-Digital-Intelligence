# Construction of Digital Reasoning Models with PyTorch
#
#
#
# Definition of Digital Intelligence(DI):
# Feild of study that builds & developes digital brains simulating the biological brain, based on The Process of Layered Processing and Probabilistic Modeling
#
#
# The Process of Layered Processing: Simulating the biological brain's cordical processes (e.g The Visual & Audial Cotrices in building Visual & Audial Awareness through layers. Initial layers extract simple features, and subsequent layers extract more advanced ones, from the image or sound <==> eyes or ears) 

#
# Probabilistic Modeling: Simulating the Prefrontal Cortex's neural network in logical reasoning and rational decison making 
#
# Prefrontal Cortex: Brain's Behavioral & Decision Center
