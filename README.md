# Construction of Digital Reasoning Models with PyTorch

 
# Definition of Digital Intelligence(DI):
Feild of study that builds & developes **digital brains** simulating the biological brain, based on The Process of **Layered/Hierarchical Processing** and **Probabilistic Modeling**


**The Process of Layered/Hierarchical Processing:** Simulating the biological brain's cordical processes (e.g The Visual & Audial Cotrices in building Visual & Audial Awareness through layers. Initial layers extract simple low level features, and subsequent layers extract more advanced high level ones(context), from the image or sound <==> eyes or ears) 


**Probabilistic Modeling:** Simulating the Prefrontal Cortex's neural network in **logical reasoning** and rational decison making 

**Visual Cortex:** The Building of visual hierarchical awareness 

**Prefrontal Cortex:** The Building of hierarchical reason (Behavioural, decision center, planning & prediction)
 

Intelligence = Hierarchical Processing
